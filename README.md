# Create your own space on Ditto!

This repository serves as an easy-to-understand example of how to get your
own space running on Ditto. 

## Overview

At a high level, creating space on Ditto consists of x steps.

1. Developer creates a public GitHub repository with a web app serving whatever content they want.
2. Developer creates a Dockerfile that containerizes the web server code, and **exposes it on port 80**
3. User creates a file called `arch.yaml` in the root directory of their project, [in the required format]().
4. The user submits their GitHub link to us [via this form](), and we'll manually review it and get it live as fast as possible!

We'll create a way to automatically submit and deploy repositories soon.
